1-We will create an employee class //student
it will have only
   -name
   -id
2- We will create one class which is EmployeeDatabase //StudentDatabase

-we will create one list we will keep employees in that list //getAllStudents()
- we will add employee to database (create an addEmployee() method) //getStudentNameContains(char ch)
- we will delete the employee from database by using id              //getStudentsIdIsBiggerThan(long id)
- we will create a method for get the all employees                   //deleteStudent(loong id)
- we will get the employee from the database which has same id from database //deleteStudentComtainsName(char ch)

3 - we will test it if it is working or not
